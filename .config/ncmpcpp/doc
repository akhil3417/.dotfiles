##### song format #####
##
## For a song format you can use:
##
## %l - length
## %f - filename
## %D - directory
## %a - artist
## %A - album artist
## %t - title
## %b - album
## %y - date
## %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
## %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
## %g - genre
## %c - composer
## %p - performer
## %d - disc
## %C - comment
## %P - priority
## $R - begin right alignment
##
## If you  want to make sure  that a part of  the format is displayed  only when
## certain tags are present, you can archieve it by grouping them with brackets,
## e.g. '{%a  - %t}'  will be  evaluated to 'ARTIST  - TITLE'  if both  tags are
## present or '' otherwise. It is also possible to define a list of alternatives
## by providing  several groups and  separating them with '|',  e.g. '{%t}|{%f}'
## will be evaluated to 'TITLE' or 'FILENAME' if the former is not present.
##
## Note: If  you want  to set limit  on maximal  length of a  tag, just  put the
## appropriate number  between % and  character that  defines tag type,  e.g. to
## make album take max. 20 terminal cells, use '%20b'.
##
## In  addition, formats  support markers  used  for text  attributes. They  are
## followed by character '$'. After that you can put:
##
## - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
## - 1 - black
## - 2 - red
## - 3 - green
## - 4 - yellow
## - 5 - blue
## - 6 - magenta
## - 7 - cyan
## - 8 - white
## - 9 - end of current color
## - b - bold text
## - u - underline text
## - r - reverse colors
## - a - use alternative character set
##
## If you don't  want to use a  non-color attribute anymore, just  put it again,
## but this time insert character '/'  between '$' and attribute character, e.g.
## {$b%t$/b}|{$r%f$/r} will display  bolded title tag or  filename with reversed
## colors.
##
## If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats (the naming
## scheme is described below in section about color definitions), it can be done
## with  the  syntax  $(COLOR), e.g.  to  set  the  artist  tag to  one  of  the
## non-standard colors  and make it  have yellow  background, you need  to write
## $(197_yellow)%a$(end). Note  that for standard colors  this is interchangable
## with attributes listed above.
##
## Note: colors can be nested.

##
## Note: Below  variables are used for  sorting songs in browser.  The sort mode
## determines how songs are  sorted, and can be used in  combination with a sort
## format   to  specify   a  custom   sorting  format.   Available  values   for
## browser_sort_mode are "name", "mtime", "format" and "noop".
##
#
#browser_sort_mode = name
#browser_sort_format = {%a - }{%t}|{%f} {(%l)}

##### columns settings #####
##
## syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."
##
## - syntax for each column is:
##
## (width of the column)[color of the column]{displayed tag}
##
## Note: Width is by default in %, if  you want a column to have fixed size, add
## 'f' after the value, e.g. (10)[white]{a} will  be the column that take 10% of
## screen  (so the  real  width  will depend  on  actual  screen size),  whereas
## (10f)[white]{a} will  take 10 terminal cells,  no matter how wide  the screen
## is.
##
## - color is optional (if you want the default one, leave the field empty).
##
## Note:  You can  give a  column additional  attributes by  putting appropriate
## character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
##
## - r - column will be right aligned
## - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed
##
## You can also:
##
## - give a  column custom name by  putting it after attributes,  separated with
##   character ':', e.g.  {lr:Length} gives you right aligned  column of lengths
##   named "Length".
##
## - define sequence of  tags, that have to be displayed  in case predecessor is
##   empty in a  way similar to the  one in classic song format,  i.e. using '|'
##   character, e.g.  {a|c|p:Owner} creates column  named "Owner" that  tries to
##   display artist tag and then composer and performer if previous ones are not
##   available.
##


##### colors definitions #####
##
## It  is  possible  to  set  a  background  color  by  setting  a  color  value
## "<foreground>_<background>", e.g.  red_black will set foregound  color to red
## and background color to black.
##
## In addition, for terminals that support 256  colors it is possible to set one
## of them  by using  a number  in range [1,  256] instead  of color  name, e.g.
## numerical  value corresponding  to  red_black  is 2_1.  To  find  out if  the
## terminal supports  256 colors, run  ncmpcpp and check  out the bottom  of the
## help screen for list of available colors and their numerical values.
##
## What  is  more, there  are  two  special  values  for the  background  color:
## "transparent" and "current". The first  one explicitly sets the background to
## be  transparent,  while  the  second  one  allows  you  to  preserve  current
## background color  and change  only the foreground  one. It's  used implicitly
## when background color is not specified.
##
## Moreover,  it is  possible to  attach  format information  to selected  color
## variables by appending  to their end a  colon followed by one  or more format
## flags, e.g. black:b or red:ur. The following variables support this syntax:
## visualizer_color, color1, color2, empty_tag_color, volume_color,
## state_line_color, state_flags_color, progressbar_color,
## progressbar_elapsed_color, player_state_color, statusbar_time_color,
## alternative_ui_separator_color.
##
## Note: due  to technical limitations of  older ncurses version, if  256 colors
## are used there is  a possibility that you'll be able to  use only colors with
